# eCommerce-Application

## Online store based on commercetools

This is a student frontend project for creating an online store based on commercetools. This project was created as [part](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/tasks/eCommerce-Application) of the [RS School](https://rs.school/) JavaScript/Front-end 2023Q1 course.
[Commercetools](https://commercetools.com/) is a flexible and powerful e-commerce platform that allows you to create modern online stores using the latest technologies.

## Project Purposes

The main purposes of this project are to:
- **Collaborate as a team:** This project provides an opportunity for team members to work together, share ideas, and learn from each other while building a real-world application.
- **Use commercetools:** This project utilizes the commercetools platform, which is a flexible and powerful e-commerce solution that allows for the creation of modern online stores using the latest technologies.
- **Create a SPA (Single Page Application):** The end result of this project is a SPA that provides a seamless shopping experience for users. The use of TypeScript to generate a SPA allows for fast and smooth transitions between different parts of the application, without the need for page reloads.

By achieving these purposes, the team will gain valuable experience in working together, using advanced technologies, and building a functional and user-friendly online store.
