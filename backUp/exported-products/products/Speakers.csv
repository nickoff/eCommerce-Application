The latest S3 version is slimmer than its predecessor, and its capable of performance above and beyond what its diminutive size may suggest.</p><p>The 707 S3&#39;s space-friendly design makes it easy to accommodate in smaller spaces, but thanks to its 1&quot; Carbon Dome tweeter, 5&quot; Continuum cone mid-bass driver, and Flowport cabinet, and other performance-enhancing features, this outstanding loudspeaker provides proof positive that size can be deceptive.</p><p>The 707 S3 draws on design and technology from the Bowers &amp; Wilkins 800 Series Diamond, resulting in a bounty of upgrades. Among the beneficial changes are a narrower and shallower cabinet, a curved baffle with protruding drivers, and upgraded driver motors, chassis, and crossover.</p><h3>Carbon Dome Tweeter</h3><p>Carbon Dome tweeters are a brand new technology purpose-built for the 700 Series. Delivering a dramatic improvement on the aluminum double dome tweeter, they raise the breakup threshold to 47kHz for pinpoint imaging accuracy and detail.</p><h3>ContinuumCone Midrange Driver</h3><p>Voices and instruments are delivered with purity and precision, thanks to the smooth, accurate Continuum cone midrange driver. First introduced with the 800 Series Diamond, the Continuum cone represents the biggest upgrade in midrange performance since Kevlar®. Its woven coated material provides highly controlled break-up, resulting in a more open, neutral midrange.</p><h3>700 S3 Series Upgrades</h3><p>Offering outstanding performance at an attainable price, the Bowers &amp; Wilkins 700 Series gives you exceptional capability for a real-world price-tag with an easy-to-accommodate footprint.</p><p>Packaged with advanced technology, the new 700 Series S3 range includes more overt celebrations of the 700 Series&#39; relationship to the Bowers &amp; Wilkins 800 Series Diamond. The first and most obvious change is the introduction of a new and longer tweeter-on-top form, inspired by the design introduced in 2021 for the new 800 Series Diamond.</p><p>The second notable change is the introduction of curved front sections to each speaker cabinet, with drive units mounted in distinct pods, as per 800 Series Diamond. Alongside this curvature, all new models feature slimmer front elevations than before, which reduces the cabinet baffling effect for even better sound than ever before.</p><p>The new S3 line also introduces new plinths, new grilles, a new tweeter grille mesh, and a new finishMocha Wood. This joins the existing finish mix of Gloss Black and White.</p><h3>Studio Sound Comes Home</h3><p>The 700 Series provides a class-leading combination of beautiful design and supreme performance. Featuring a wealth of state-of-the-art technologies, many derived from the 800 Series Diamond range, the 700 Series provides true Bowers &amp; Wilkins performance in a class-leading yet accessible package.</p><p>With two center channel speakers and a subwoofer to choose from, the 700 Series also performs brilliantly in any home cinema set-up. It is a particularly strong aspect of the ranges appeal. The updated design means that the 700 S3 line looks every bit as good as it sounds. Its the perfect combination of elegance and performance.</p>","","","bowers-wilkins-707-s3","","","","","false","true","Standard Tax Category","Embedded","2023-08-29T05:45:21.475Z","2023-09-14T09:38:38.099Z",1,"https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/BW707S3_MOC_01-Large-sycuWZq5.jpg|Two speakers|1280x1280;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/BW707S3_MOC_02-Large-QDfS1c3-.jpg|Front|1280x1280;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/BW707S3_MOC_03-Large-7mWjeYL2.jpg|Back|1280x1280;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/BW707S3_MOC_01-Large-wT9LK33H.jpg||360x360;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/BW707S3_MOC_02-Large-OzSzdm5P.jpg||360x360","USD 89000","b&w","#652F1C;Mocha"

With an ideal combination of size and power, it blends the company&#39;s advanced Continuum™ midrange cone with an improved crossover for even more insight into your music. 25 years on, it remains the standard for attainable performance loudspeakers. Like its smaller sibling, the 607 S2, the 606 S2 is an ideal speaker for stereo or surround sound use.</p><p>Rivaling the range and reach of many floorstanding speakers on the market, the 602 S2 Anniversary Edition takes the award-winning 606 formula and improves upon it, complementing the 6.5&quot; Continuum cone with a Decoupled Double-dome 1&quot; aluminum dome tweeter and beautiful new finishes.</p><p>In his CNET.com review for November 7, 2020, Ty Pendlebury calls the 606 S2 &quot;a real sonic upgrade that brings to mind the more expensive 700 series: These speakers bring transparency and slam in equal parts.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The biggest differences are heard in the bass. The new version is so much more precise and controlled in this region,&quot; notes England&#39;s What Hi-Fi? magazine, which honored the 606 S2 with Best Speaker Award for 2020. &quot;On an initial listen it would be easy to conclude that the older model has more weight in this area, but given time it becomes clear that the S2s are cleaner, more insightful and have notably more punch.&quot;</p><h3>Layered, Beautiful Details</h3><p>The new 606 S2 Anniversary Edition adopts a refined and upgraded version of the proven Decoupled Double Dome tweeter, offering 38kHz breakup performance. The result? An accurate and immersive reproduction of your favorite music.</p><p>The Double Dome design comprises a 35-micron aluminum diaphragm reinforced with a 50-micron ring profile bonded to the rear surface of the dome. This stiffens the structure in its weakest area and pushes the break-up frequency of the structure up to 38kHz. At the same time, this approach minimizes the amount of mass being added to the assembly.</p><p>The tweeter is fully decoupled from the loudspeaker cabinet, achieved by housing the high-frequency assembly so that it effectively floats free of the baffle. This isolates any of the energy generated by the tweeter from the cabinet, therefore reducing any unwanted sound generated by the cabinet itself and also stopping any of the low and mid­ frequency energy (generated by the larger drive units in the enclosure) from affecting the tweeter&#39;s output.</p><h3>Continuum™ Cone Midwoofer</h3><p>Voices and instruments are delivered with purity and precision, thanks to the revolutionary Continuum™ cone midwoofer, as found in Bowers &amp; Wilkins flagship 800 Series Diamond. Once reserved for only the company&#39;s most revered models, Continuum brings you a cleaner and more accurate performance.</p><p>The Continuum cone creates layered midrange sound with a pristine soundscape. The human ear is naturally tuned into sound in this frequency, and Bowers &amp; Wilkins has understood the power of the perfect midrange presentation for over a generation.</p><p>Developed over an eight-year period, the Continuum cone was first featured on the company&#39;s flagship 800 Series Diamond models, including the 800 D3, used in Abbey Road Studios. It truly makes your music come alive, delivering the crucial sounds fundamental to any great music experience.</p><p>For powerful low frequency performance, the 606 S2 Anniversary Edition features two optimized low-frequency cones that combine terrific extension and superlative accuracy to give high levels of controlled bass with your favorite music and movies.</p><h3>Optimized Crossover And Bi-Wirable Speaker Terminals</h3><p>In addition to the celebratory cosmetic changes, the 600 Series Anniversary Edition also benefits from a new optimized crossover design featuring carefully selected components, offering greater insight from your music.</p><p>The 606 S2 has two linked pairs of speaker terminals on the back. For conventional connection, the terminal links should remain in place as delivered and just one pair of terminals connected to the amplifier. For bi-wire connections or bi-amplification, the terminal links should be removed and each pair of terminals connected to the amplifier or amplifiers independently. Bi-wiring can improve the resolution of low-level detail.</p>","","","bowers-wilkins-606-s2","","","","","false","true","Standard Tax Category","Embedded","2023-08-29T05:56:03.958Z","2023-09-14T09:32:35.918Z",1,"https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/BW606S2_WHT_01-Large-OjC3Xr-u.jpg|Side|1280x1280;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/BW606S2_WHT_02-Large-zRJbrZCT.jpg|Front|1280x1280;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/BW606S2_WHT_04-Large-oDPqi-9a.jpg|Back|1280x1280;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/BW606S2_WHT_01-Large-8yoFr7Kl.jpg||360x360;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/BW606S2_WHT_02-Large-Qn7rwo6x.jpg||360x360","USD 89900","b&w","#fff;White"

It uses a bass reflex enclosure with rear-firing Tractrix® Port.</p><h3>90° X 90° Silicon Composite Hybrid Tractrix Horn</h3><p>Horn loading maximizes efficiently and increases detail, while focusing high frequencies towards the listening area. Proprietary Tractrix® geometry provides the most efficient transfer of high frequency waves into the listening area. The phase plug and compressed molded silicon face ensure smooth frequency response. When combined, the cleanest, most natural sound possible is created. The second generation increases horn size for a larger soundstage and enhanced directivity.</p><h3>Linear Travel Suspension (LTS) Titanium Diaphragm Tweeter</h3><p>The exclusive Linear Travel Suspension minimizes distortion for enhanced, detailed performance. LTS tweeters are a hallmark of previous Klipsch Reference lines, making it a core component of some of the best speakers in the world.</p><p>The vented tweeter housing reduces standing waves that create unwanted harmonics, resulting in enhanced detail and clarity in high frequency reproduction.</p><h3>Cerametallic Woofers All New Design</h3><p>A signature feature of the Reference Premiere series, Cerametallic woofers are exceptionally rigid and lightweight for minimal distortion and maximum efficiency. New aluminum shorting rings reduce distortion as well as increased power handling and the new motor structure improve transit response with more control with greater speed and accuracy.</p><h3>Tractrix Ports</h3><p>Utilizing Tractrix geometry, the Reference Premiere ports allow for the most efficient, fastest air transfer from the cabinet, which reduces port noise for punchier low frequencies. Klipsch Tractrix ports have custom designed inner flares that help reduce air turbulence entering the port. Less turbulent air helps reduce port noise for cleaner, more powerful bass.</p><h3>Bi-Wiring / Bi-Amping Capability</h3><p>Dual input terminals give you bi-wiring / bi-amping capabilities. Bi-wiring separates high and low frequency current into separate speaker cables, reducing intermodulation distortion, for clearer midrange. Bi-amping allows for customization using outboard crossovers when using separate amplifiers.</p><h3>New, Improved Input Panel</h3><p>Connections get a nice make over, featuring audiophile-grade wire and easily accessible aluminum binding posts for any connection type. Enjoy a whole new level of convenience.</p><h3>More First-Class Perks</h3><p>A strong, flexible, removable grille attaches magnetically for an elegant transition from powerful showstopper to discrete performance piece. Finishes include ebony vinyl and walnut vinyl that boast satin painted baffles with a scratch resistant finish. Cork pads replace standard rubber bumpers for security on a stand or table.</p>","","","klipsch-reference-premiere-ii-rp-600m-ii","","","","","false","true","Standard Tax Category","Embedded","2023-08-29T05:49:45.010Z","2023-09-14T09:39:16.176Z",1,"https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/RP-600M-II-WALNUT-00-XqJia07b.jpg|Two speakers|2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/RP-600M-II-Walnut-00-9wuJNqhD.jpg|Back|2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/RP-600M-II-WALNUT-00-uZfstlUJ.jpg||360x360;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/RP-600M-II-Walnut-00-KQFKNWho.jpg||360x360","USD 70000","klipsch","#31241A;Dark Walnut"
