The human auditory characteristic by which low frequency range becomes easier to hear as sound volume increases has also been taken into consideration. As a result, in comparison to the D8000 which is suitable particularly for classical music and other selections featuring a wide dynamic range, the D8000 Pro Edition provides sound quality perceived to be of higher clarity when listening to rock, pops and other selections that feature a narrow dynamic range.</p><h3>A combination of the sensitive high ranges of planar magnetic models and the volume and open feel bass tones of dynamic models</h3><p>With conventional planar magnetic models, amplitude is an increasing low range, and since the diaphragm comes into contact with magnets, it was necessary to raise the frequency of bass tones to a level that the driver unit can reproduce. To make up for the lack of bass tones, the inside of the earpads have been tightly sealed, and the front section of the diaphragm has been made a closed space.</p><p>This is the same principle as earphones with sealed earpieces being able to reproduce bass frequencies despite their small size. By sealing the inner earpads, it is possible to produce bass tones across low frequency bands; these become the bass tones produced within a sealed space the same as earphones.</p><p>With D8000, the problem with the diaphragm coming into contact with magnets has been solved through AFDS (Air Film Damping System), and it has become possible to reduce the frequency of the bass tones that the driver unit can reproduce. Combined with breathable earpads, bass tone reproduction with a volume and open sound only achievable with superior dynamic models is possible.</p><p>In reproducing subtle high frequencies, the lightweight nature of the diaphragm comes before anything else. Compared to other dynamic models with the same diameter, D8000&#39;s diaphragm is 1/3 lighter. A super thin aluminium coil has been etched on the extremely lightweight film diaphragm, and as such, the adhesive essential for use between the coil and the diaphragm of dynamic models - which has a very negative effect on sound quality - is not necessary. With the D8000 Pro Edition, problems originating from the adhesive have been fundamentally resolved, and the reproduction of a delicate sound in high frequency range has been achieved.</p><h3>Newly-developed AFDS: Air Film Damping System</h3><p>With conventional planar magnetic models, amplitude was an increasing low range, and the diaphragm came into contact with magnets. To solve this problem, we took measurements by conducting diaphragm simulations using the finite element method and laser Doppler devices numerous times, and established new diaphragm braking technology known as AFDS - Air Film Damping System.</p><p>In doing so, the shortcoming of planar magnetic models - the low reproducibility of bass tones - was solved. This technology could be considered a reinvention of planar magnetic models.</p><p>With D8000 Pro Edition, the problem with the diaphragm coming into contact with magnets has been solved through AFDS (Air Film Damping System), and it has become possible to reduce the frequency of the bass tones that the driver unit can reproduce. Combined with breathable earpads, bass tone reproduction with a volume and open sound only achievable with superior dynamic models is possible.</p><h3>Designed with prolonged use and ease of repair in mind</h3><p>So as to make repairs and future upgrades possible, almost every part has been designed in such a way that they can be disassembled, ensuring that the product can be used for many years following purchase.</p><h3>A machined aluminium magnesium alloy housing</h3><p>To establish AFDS, an extremely high level of precision compared to typical driver units is necessary. Because of this, the machined aluminium magnesium alloy housing has been machined with great precision. Black sports a leathercoat finish such as that used for expensive cameras. Silver has been imparted with an Alumite anodized aluminium finish.</p><h3>Manufactured at our own factory, this model espouses precision</h3><p>The D8000 series is manufactured at our head office in Kawasaki.together with the precision of individual parts, the precision involved in the assembly process depends on the precision of the tools known as jigs that assist in the assembly process. So as to be able to fine-tune even the slightest of irregularities in jig precision during the assembly process, we design and manufacture production jigs and measurement jigs ourselves.</p><p>We developed manufacturing apparatus such as a diaphragm formation machine and a diaphragm tension meter in-house, specifically for the D8000 series.</p><p>To create truly good products, it is necessary to get to the core of the manufacturing process of parts close to the raw material. What is good about &quot;made in Japan&quot; is that when doing so, you can gain the cooperation of those manufacturers close to the material. By controlling everything together, from sourcing the raw materials through to the assembly of the product, we have achieved high-quality products.</p>","","","final-audio-d8000-pro-afds-open-planar-magnetic-headphones","","","","","false","true","Standard Tax Category","Embedded","2023-09-08T07:02:05.293Z","2023-09-14T09:39:41.047Z",1,"https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Final-Audio-D8000-Pr-ax4oS3Po.png||2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Final-Audio-D8000-Pr-QKWNaq1X.png||2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/D8000ProEdition05_89-4xuVBE_q.png||1000x1000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Final-Audio-D8000-Pr-9NyAatYw.png||360x360;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Final-Audio-D8000-Pr-MnC559Ub.png||360x360","USD 499900","silver;Silver"

Renowned for its use in high-end audio speakers due to its fine acoustic characteristics and durability, the striking red Asada Zakura suppresses unwanted resonance inside the earcups for clear, natural sound reproduction. The half-gloss finish, applied by hand, accentuates the wood&#39;s gentle grain and warm beauty.</p><p>The headphones are equipped with exclusive 53 mm drivers with powerful magnetic circuitry, integrated pure-iron yoke, DLC (diamond-like carbon) coating, and 6N-OFC (high-purity, oxygen-free copper) voice coils for exceptional full-range audio reproduction. Our exclusive D.A.D.S. (Double Air Damping System), which divides the housing structure into two separate acoustic chambers, ensures smooth, accurate bass response. The arms that hold the housings are made from a lightweight, highly rigid magnesium alloy.</p><p>The arms are angled to provide the best possible fit with excellent earcup seal. The comfortable fit is enhanced by smooth, synthetic leather earpads and headband. The headphones also feature A2DC (Audio Designed Detachable Coaxial) jacks for secure connection to the two included 3.0 m (9.8&#39;) detachable cables. One cable has a 6.3 mm (1/4&quot;) gold-plated stereo plug for use with standard audio equipment. The other cable features a 4-pin XLRM balanced connector for use with the latest high-fidelity equipment to achieve better channel separation.</p><p>About High-Resolution Audio In Brief: The Move to Hi-Res Audio While many listeners may believe that high-resolution audio came along with the introduction of the Compact Disc in 1982, constraints on the disc&#39;s storage space always prevented CD audio (standardized at 44.1 kHz/16-bit) from fully and completely reproducing the original recorded sound. The advent and subsequent popularity of MP3s only made this problem more pronounced the necessary compression of these files causes audio information to be lost, thus greatly reducing the audio quality. But with lossless audio file formats, faster Internet speeds, and storage space increasingly easy to come by (and in ever-smaller packages), the push is on to create audio equipment capable of capturing and reproducing true Hi-Res Audio, generally considered to be 96 kHz/24-bit or better. The Hi-Res Audio logo certifies that a product meets the Hi-Res Audio standards. Per these standards, headphones must have transducer frequency performance to at least 40 kHz. As a producer of these types of audiophile headphones since 1972, Audio-Technica is well-positioned to provide audio solutions that meet the demands of Hi-Res Audio media formats, allowing for the full reproduction of their extended sonic characteristics.</p>","","","audio-technica-ath-awas-closed-back-headphones","","","","","false","true","Standard Tax Category","Embedded","2023-09-08T11:17:51.091Z","2023-09-14T09:47:52.334Z",1,"https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Audio-TechnicaATH-AW-Qpvx1DgM.png||2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Audio-TechnicaATH-AW-qMeuAG6P.png||2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Audio-TechnicaATH-AW-niDz0zDJ.png||2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Audio-TechnicaATH-AW-nhT7IW3N.png||360x360;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Audio-TechnicaATH-AW-DCv4IdBL.png||360x360","USD 249900","red;Red"

Here, we’ve fused a thin slice of flame-grain maple on top of solid, machined maple to produce housings that ensure clear, natural sound quality. The flame maple finish, provided by Japanese guitar manufacturer Fujigen, brings out the unique grain of each housing for a one-of-a-kind beauty that will deepen with age.</p><p>The headphones are equipped with exclusive 53 mm drivers with powerful magnetic circuitry, DLC (diamond-like carbon) coating, and top-mounted PCB construction for exceptional full-range audio reproduction. A specially designed angled baffle improves airflow between the front and rear of the diaphragm for better low- to mid-range audio reproduction, and also optimally positions the earcups over the ears for improved comfort and sound containment.</p><p>The headphones also feature A2DC (Audio Designed Detachable Coaxial) jacks for secure connection to the two included 1.2 m (3.9′) detachable cables. One cable has a 3.5 mm (1/8″) gold-plated stereo mini-plug for use with smartphones and standard audio devices. The other cable is equipped with a 4.4 mm (1/6″), 5-pole gold-plated balanced plug for use with high-resolution digital audio players and balanced-compatible headphone amplifiers.</p><p>The earpads and headband of the ATH-WP900 are made from smooth, synthetic leather for long-lasting comfort, and the earcups swivel-flat for easy transport in the included carrying pouch.</p>","","","audio-technica-ath-wp900-portable-closed-back-headphones","","","","","false","true","Standard Tax Category","Embedded","2023-09-08T08:35:43.075Z","2023-09-14T09:47:36.716Z",1,"https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Audio-TechnicaATH-WP-tCWY07Z8.png||2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Audio-TechnicaATH-WP-q2XEbd9W.png||2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Audio-TechnicaATH-WP-kfQX4enF.png||2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Audio-TechnicaATH-WP-0pOFv_9M.png||360x360;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Audio-TechnicaATH-WP-l-KO-Jz6.png||360x360","USD 109900","orange;Orange"

Their updated headband design will accommodate a wider range of head sizes. Their planar driver is the cornerstone of their remarkable sound.</p><p>The headphones have an updated earcup design trimmed down in size for a slimmer, sleeker look; they are now 11mm in thickness, a significant reduction in size from the original model&#39;s 14mm measurement.</p><p>The earpads have become thicker with an asymmetrical shape that follows the form of the earcups. They are supplied with a cable that is made stronger with the improved materials of crystalline copper and crystalline silver wire and built with a wide frequency range, low signal loss, and enhanced emphasis on their low-end for quality audio reproduction. A 1/8&quot; cable and a 4-pin XLR cable are also included.</p>","","","hifiman-he-1000-v2-stealth-open-back-planar-magnetic-headphones","","","","","false","true","Standard Tax Category","Embedded","2023-09-08T10:56:27.182Z","2023-09-14T09:47:28.562Z",1,"https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/HiFiMAN_HE-1000v2-1_-KpmdepDD.png||2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/HiFiMAN_HE-1000v2-3_-Y8fzhyLe.png||2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/HiFiMAN_HE-1000v2-2_-Ja4CrDx6.png||2000x2000;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/HiFiMAN_HE-1000v2-1_-84Io9YHi.png||360x360;https://5aee0309b419a41c35ac-30f40b40023ba9dbd1c87d581816410c.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/HiFiMAN_HE-1000v2-2_-CuAH_UZJ.png||360x360","USD 319900|255920","orange;Orange"
